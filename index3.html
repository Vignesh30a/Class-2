    <p>Hi! In this site I'll introduce you to chess.</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">
        <b>Chess is a board game for two players.</b> It is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. 
        <em>It is played on a square board consisting of 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid.</em> The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns, with each type of piece having a different pattern of movement.
        An enemy piece may be captured (removed from the board) by moving one's own piece onto the square it occupies.
        <mark>The object of the game is to "checkmate" (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. </mark>
        There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.</blockquote>
